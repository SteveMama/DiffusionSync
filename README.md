# DiffusionSync
Lip Sync using Spectrogram analysis linked with Diffusion models to generate realistic mouth pieces.

1. Diffusion model take up as much as one hour to generate realistic mouth piece at 480p resolution. 
2. Training on A100 locally would probably generate better results.
3. cache withdrawal could potentially generate better results.
4. Generate vids of 480p resolution, 20 seconds clips.

* a. Dated: 28th Nov: Upscaled video without audio added. Stable diffusion upscales to 720p.
* b. Dated: 28th Nov: https://youtu.be/DKaYazpKhJ0 , Upscaled video to 1080p. Diffusion activated
